# ui
### Welcome to the UI repository for the spotify build week project!

This end of the application has no dependencies but uses *less* so in this case you might want the less-watch-compiler to play with.

#### Font Awsome

The *font awsome* implementation used with this project was based off of their guide under the *less* how-two which can be found [here](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/less)

---

#### Less

To get less up and running with this project you will first need to make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed onto your system. Once *node* is up and running using the node package manager go ahead and type out...

'''
npm install -g less
'''

with that less should be installed and you are all set!
